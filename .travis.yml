    # make sure we work with a range of node versions.
    # As of the time of writing:
    #  - 4.x is still in LTS (until April 2018), but some of our deps (notably
    #    extract-zip) don't work with it
    #  - 5.x has been EOLed for nearly a year.
    #  - 6.x is the current 'LTS' version
    #  - 7.x is the current 'current' version (until October 2017)
